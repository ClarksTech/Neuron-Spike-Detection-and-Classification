This folder contains all required files to run neuron peak detection and classification using CNN and KNN models.

Anaconda 3.8.8 python was used, in addition to Keras from Tersorflow, directions to install Keras and Tensorflow are described below:

TensorFlow Installation:

1. Open anaconda navigator
2. On the left select environments
3. select base (root)
4. on the right in the 'search packages' box type: "tensorflow"
5. if tensorflow 2.3.0 shows up skip to Keras install, else go to next step
6. from the dropdown change from 'installed' to 'Not installed'
7. click the box next to tensorflow, and at the bottom right select apply
8. click apply again on the popup and allow the package to install

Keras Installation:

1. Open anaconda navigator

3. select base (root)
4. on the right in the 'search packages' box type: "Keras"
5. if keras 2.4.3 shows up you have all required packages installed skip to environment setup, else go to next step
